Not everything in modern software needs to follow traditional principles like SOLID, OOP, or Agile™ to the letter. Many of us have discovered, through experience, that the world of code is messier—and more human—than those rules suggest.

I’ve started collecting the principles and patterns that I find actually help teams build, maintain, and deliver good software—especially in fast-moving, real-world environments.

Here are a few I lean on:

## FPOOP – Functional Plus Object-Oriented Programming

I reach for functional style first—pure functions, composition, and avoiding side effects—but I don’t dismiss OOP entirely.
OOP brings structure, but over time (especially when teams change), it can become a tangle of inheritance and hidden state. It’s easy to fall into the trap of creating new classes to model every noun, making testing painful and maintenance worse.

FPOOP is a reminder: use OOP when it helps model behaviour explicitly, and default to functions and data where possible.

## Locality of Behaviour (LOB) – Keep It in Context

SOLID’s "S" is for Single Responsibility, and some folks like Uncle Bob suggest functions should be just a few lines. I get the point—it’s about clarity.
But I follow **Locality of Behaviour** instead.

A function might be 60–80 lines long, and that's okay—if you can understand everything it does right there.

“The larger the part of an implementation you can understand by looking at it—without jumping between files—the better.”

By keeping related behaviour together, I reduce mental overhead, simplify debugging, and make accidental breakage less likely.

## Modules Over Layers – Organize by Concern, Not Type

Instead of organizing code into folders like controllers/, models/, and services/, I organize by feature or domain.
Each module or domain folder has everything it needs—routes, services, types, tests—co-located. It makes onboarding easier and keeps changes local.

Think src/users/ with all the user-related logic together, instead of chasing files across the project.

## TDD-ish – Test When It Helps

I believe in testing—but not in 100% test coverage or writing tests before every line of code.

I write tests:

- When I want to lock down logic
- When bugs pop up
- When I'm building something risky or important

Sometimes I write tests first. Sometimes later. But I don’t let the dogma get in the way of flow.

## Delivery-Driven Development

Rather than dogmatic architecture, you ask: "What do we need to deliver this thing reliably and safely?"

Shipping value > meeting an arbitrary principle.

## Good Enough is Good Enough – Working code is better than perfect architecture

Perfect is the enemy of done. I’ve worked on teams that over-designed upfront and never shipped.
Now, I aim to get something useful working—then iterate and improve.
That doesn’t mean rushing garbage into prod. It means recognizing when a design is "good enough" to unblock learning or delivery. _As a side note search "Good Enough Donald Winnicott software"_

## Cognitive Budget Awareness – Don’t waste attention

Every team/individual has a limited “cognitive budget.” If your architecture, naming, or conventions are hard to follow, that budget gets burned fast.

I strive for defaults, clarity, and consistency so people can focus on logic—not deciphering the project.

The same thing for context switching, it quickly saps your cognitive resources. There is no such thing as Multitasking, its is a myth

## Minimum Process, Maximum Outcome – Don't let process become the product

I’ve been in stand ups that waste time and retros that become therapy sessions.
Meetings, Jira boards, planning poker—all useful only if they serve the team’s momentum and outcomes.

If something doesn’t help us move forward or solve a real problem, it’s on the chopping block.

## You Can Always Delete It – Don’t overthink first drafts

Whether it's code, docs, or diagrams—start rough.
Write the ugly version. Draw the bad diagram. You can always clean it up later.
This mindset kills perfectionism and gets momentum going fast.

## Exploration is not Waste – Some tangents are necessary

Some dev time will be "wasted"—spikes, ideas that didn’t pan out, tools you end up ditching. That’s fine.

Exploring dead ends is how you know you’re on the right path.

Not everything should go into version control, but play and exploration are part of serious work.

## Scotty Principle

The Urban Dictionary defines The Scotty Principle as:

The defacto gold star standard for delivering products and/or services within a projected timeframe. Derived from the original Star Trek series wherein Lt. Cmdr. Montgomery ‘Scotty’ Scott consistently made the seemingly impossible happen just in time to save the crew of the Enterprise from disaster.

The premise is simple:

1. Caluculate average required time for completion of given task.
2. Depending on importance of task, add 25-50% additional time to original estimate.
3. Report and commit to inflated time estimate with superiors, clients, etc.
4. Under optimal conditions the task is completed closer to the original time estimate vs. the inflated delivery time expected by those waiting.

There are, of course, corollaries associated with it, like the use of techno-babble. See, Scotty always had excuses to why things would take a long time. “I have to re-calculate the deterioration of dilithium, since we’re using it an accelerated rate due to the ion storm.” This isn’t just a factor of Star Trek, mind you. Where Scotty would say “Someone has to go into the Jeffries Tube!” Doctor Who would say “I have to reverse the polarity of the neutron flow.”

So here are my Scotty School Rules for Support.

1. Always pad your time estimates. (“Well. I can PROBABLY do it in a week.”)
2. Always use big words. (“Just because we violated proper procedure doesn’t abrogate your need to follow it.”)
3. Always use buzz words. (“Actually, SEO will be adversely impacted by FrontPage due to it’s lack of support of Web 3.0 and HTML5.”)
4. Always be honest. (“No, it’s not complicated, it’s just time consuming.”)
5. Always say you can do it. (“Rebuild the entire program in a language I’ve never heard of? Sure.”)
6. Always do it the right way. (“You want me to use FrontPage to build a website? No.”)
7. If they make you do it the wrong way, pad your estimate to allow you a chance to do it BOTH ways. (“Yeah, I did the blog on FrontPage, but it looks weird, so I mocked it up on WordPress.”)
