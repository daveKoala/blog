I’ve been working on compiling a set of questions we ask at the outset of each new feature. In my experience, teams can become laser-focused on coding and implementation without considering the broader context. It’s crucial to ask the right questions early on to demonstrate the value of our work and align it with both technical requirements and organizational objectives.

For every new feature, consider the following aspects and questions. The responses can help inform the creation of tickets and detailed specifications.

| **Aspect**                              | **Questions**                                                                                                                                                            |
