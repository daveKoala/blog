# DRAFT

Modern JavaScript and TypeScript projects can benefit from NASA/JPL’s _Power of 10_ coding rules – originally created for C in safety-critical systems – by adapting them to fit today’s development practices. The goal is to keep code safe, maintainable, and performant without slowing development. Each rule below is rewritten for JS/TS/Node, with an explanation of **why it matters** and examples of **how to apply it**, emphasizing automation-friendly guidelines for code reviews and tools.

## 1. Keep Control Flow Simple (Avoid Complex Constructs)

**Adapted Rule:** Use straightforward control structures and avoid overly complex flow. In JavaScript/TypeScript this means no equivalent of `goto` (avoid label/break trickery) and use recursion sparingly. Favour simple loops, early returns, and small functions over deeply nested logic.

**Rationale:** Eliminating “unstructured” flow makes the code easier to read and less error-prone. Deep recursion in JS can lead to stack overflow. Simple flow aids understanding and tool analysis.

**Examples:**

```ts
// Bad: deeply nested
function process(data) {
  if (data) {
    if (data.valid) {
      if (!data.done) {
        // ... logic ...
      }
    }
  }
}

// Good: early returns
function process(data) {
  if (!data || !data.valid || data.done) return;
  // ... main logic ...
}
```

## 2. Ensure Loops Have Bounded Iteration (No Runaway Loops)

**Adapted Rule:** All loops should have a clear, fixed limit or termination condition.

**Rationale:** Prevent infinite loops that can block the UI or event loop in Node. Bounded loops make behaviour and performance predictable.

**Examples:**

```ts
// Bad: potentially infinite
while (!jobDone) {
  checkStatus();
}

// Good: bounded
let attempts = 0;
const MAX_ATTEMPTS = 1000;
while (!jobDone && attempts < MAX_ATTEMPTS) {
  checkStatus();
  attempts++;
}
```

## 3. Manage Memory and Resources Prudently (Avoid Unbounded Allocation)

**Adapted Rule:** Avoid unbounded memory growth. JS uses garbage collection, but design code to limit memory use.

**Rationale:** Prevent slowdowns and crashes. Especially critical in long-running Node processes or browsers.

**Examples:**

```ts
// Bad: read entire large file
const data = fs.readFileSync("hugefile.txt");

// Good: stream the file
const stream = fs.createReadStream("hugefile.txt");
stream.on("data", (chunk) => {
  // process chunk
});
```

## 4. Keep Functions Small and Focused

**Adapted Rule:** Keep functions under 50-60 lines. Each should do one thing well.

**Rationale:** Easier to understand, test, and review. Supports the single responsibility principle.

**Examples:**

```ts
// Better: refactor into clear steps
function processOrder(order) {
  validateOrder(order);
  chargePayment(order);
  updateInventory(order);
  notifyUser(order);
}
```

## 5. Validate Inputs and Assumptions with Runtime Checks

**Adapted Rule:** Include validations/assertions in functions, especially for critical inputs and outputs.

**Rationale:** Prevent subtle bugs by catching incorrect usage or bad data early.

**Examples:**

```ts
function getUserProfile(userId: string) {
  if (typeof userId !== "string") {
    throw new TypeError("Expected userId to be a string");
  }
}

// Exhaustive type checking
function handleStatus(status: "ok" | "fail") {
  if (status === "ok") return;
  if (status === "fail") return;
  const _exhaustive: never = status;
  throw new Error(`Unhandled status: ${status}`);
}
```

## 6. Minimize Scope and Shared Mutable State

**Adapted Rule:** Limit variables to their smallest needed scope. Avoid globally shared mutable state.

**Rationale:** Reduces complexity and accidental side-effects. Makes code easier to reason about and garbage collect.

**Examples:**

```ts
// Good: limited scope
function sum(arr: number[]) {
  let total = 0;
  for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    total += arr[i];
  }
  return total;
}
```

## 7. Handle All Return Values and Errors

**Adapted Rule:** Always handle return values from functions, or clearly indicate when intentionally ignored.

**Rationale:** Prevent missed errors or logic failures.

**Examples:**

```ts
// Bad: ignoring promise
doSomethingAsync();

// Good: await or catch
await doSomethingAsync();

// Or:
doSomethingAsync().catch((err) => console.error(err));
```

## 8. Use Meta-Programming Sparingly (Avoid `eval` and Hidden Magic)

**Adapted Rule:** Avoid `eval`, dynamic code generation, and confusing meta-programming.

**Rationale:** Hard to debug, insecure, and breaks tooling.

**Examples:**

```ts
// Bad
eval("console.log('Hi')");

// Good
const fn = () => console.log("Hi");
fn();
```

## 9. Avoid Unnecessary Indirection and Side Effects

**Adapted Rule:** Keep data flow and function calls direct. Avoid mutating inputs or creating layers of abstraction without value.

**Rationale:** Reduces debugging pain and improves readability.

**Examples:**

```ts
// Bad: mutates external object
function addItem(list: string[], item: string) {
  list.push(item);
}

// Good: returns new copy
function addItem(list: string[], item: string) {
  return [...list, item];
}
```

## 10. Enable All Warnings and Fix Them (Use Your Tools)

**Adapted Rule:** Turn on all relevant compiler and linter warnings, and fix them.

**Rationale:** Prevents issues early and reinforces consistency.

**Examples:**

```json
// tsconfig.json
"strict": true,
"noUnusedLocals": true,
"noImplicitReturns": true
```

```js
// .eslintrc.js
module.exports = {
  rules: {
    "no-unused-vars": "error",
    "no-eval": "error",
    "no-console": "warn",
  },
};
```

**Conclusion:** These adapted rules provide a practical standard for large teams using JS/TS/Node. They promote clarity, safety, and consistency — and can be enforced through code review and automation. When used well, they reduce bugs, improve maintainability, and help build stakeholder confidence in your team's output.
