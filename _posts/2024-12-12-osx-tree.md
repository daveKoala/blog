The `tree` command shows the folder structure of the current directory. Use the `-d` option to only show directories. The `-I` option lets you exclude certain directories. For example:

```
tree -I node_modules
```

To exclude multiple directories, separate their names with |:

```
tree -I 'node_modules|cache|notes|test*'
```

This will hide `node_modules`, cache, notes, and any directories starting with test from the output.

`tree` is installed with brew

```
brew install tree
```
