## The Rise of the Methodology Priesthood

In the beginning, there was chaos.  
And into this chaos walked the **Shaman**.

Not one shaman — many.  
Each bearing a doctrine.  
Each declaring **_The Way_**.

They gathered followers. They declared best practices. They warned of ruin for the unconverted.

Behold! Tremble before the **Methodology Priesthood**.

## The Agile Shaman

He chants the _Stand-Up Sutra_.  
He divides the moon into sprints and burns his charts religiously.  
You question the ritual? He whispers:

> "You're not doing it right."

If it doesn't work, do more of it.  
Still doesn’t work? **Double your velocity**.

## The Clean Code Shaman

Wears robes stitched with Uncle Bob’s misunderstood commandments.  
Speaks only in single sentences.  
Sacrifices duplication on the altar of abstraction.

To disobey is to risk... **the great spaghetti refactoring**.

---

## The Microservices Shaman

Divides everything.  
Then divides the divisions.  
Lunch is packed in separate containers, accessed via a RESTful fork.

Scales rituals independently.  
Worships at the Temple of K8s.  
Mantra: _"This could be a service."_

## The React Shaman

Summons Components.  
Binds State.  
Offers sacrifices to the Hooks Deities.

When you ask _why_, he responds:

> "Just trust the re-render cycle."

---

## The Doctrine

Each priesthood begins with wisdom.  
But soon, the tools become rules.  
The patterns become dogma.  
The advice becomes a liturgy.

If things don’t work, it’s not the method.  
**You** just need to _believe harder_.

## The Exit from Orthodoxy

Here’s the thing:

- Agile has value — when guided by people, not cargo cults.
- Clean code helps — unless it suffocates shipping.
- Microservices work — for Netflix, maybe not your team of 3.
- React is fine — until everything is a custom hook abstraction.

Use what works.  
Understand the trade-offs.  
Context matters.

The priesthood is seductive.  
But progress often comes when someone quietly says:

> _"What if we just solved the problem?"_

**Blessed be the pragmatists. A haiku**

Pragmatists just ship
Others trapped in meetings about
Sprint planning meetings
