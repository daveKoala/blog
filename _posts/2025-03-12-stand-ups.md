Keeping focus on value

This is based on an excellent [article]

## Walk-the-Board stand-up\*

**00:00** The team joins the call.

**00:00** Facilitator: “Good morning, everyone! Let’s walk the board. Remember to keep updates concise and focus on blockers or anything that needs team input. XXX hasn’t joined yet, but let’s begin — I hope he’ll join soon.”

**00:01** Facilitator: “I see that someone moved Ticket XYZ-123 to the Done column. Great!” 00:01 Facilitator: “Let’s start with the In Progress column.”

**00:02** Facilitator: “Ticket XYZ-456” Developer 1: “I’m making good progress. No issues. No blockers.”

**00:03** Facilitator: “Ticket DEF-789” Developer 3: “I’ve started this bug, but I’m stuck on the API integration. XXX, you worked on something similar recently — can we discuss it after the call?” Developer 1: “Sure, I’ll help you after the stand-up.”

**00:04** Facilitator: “Ticket ABC-123” Developer 2: “I’m making good progress. No issues. No blockers.”

**00:05** Facilitator: “Ticket GHI-101: Bug fix (flagged as blocked).” Dev 4: “This is still blocked because I’m waiting for the infrastructure team to answer my question. I pinged them yesterday, and I’ll follow up again this morning.” Facilitator: “If you don’t hear back by noon, let’s escalate it.”

**00:05** Facilitator: “To Do Column: Ticket JKL-202. This ticket is next up. Any concerns before someone picks it up?” Dev 2: “None from me. I’ll take this after finishing ABC-123.” Facilitator: “Sounds good.”

**00:06** Wrap-Up Facilitator: “That’s everything on the board. Let’s stay on for a few minutes to discuss the API issue. Anything else?” Team: Silence. Facilitator: “Alright, let’s get to work!”

## Fight the blockers

The goal is to improve the flow. Anything that stops work being delivered should be fixed quickly and it make no sense to keep them\*

Make it a priority for the whole team to resolve blockers. First, ensure it is crystal clear when a ticket is blocked. 'Flag' as blocked.

The flag means that no one can work on the ticket due to various reasons, such as:

- Waiting for a response from another team.
- Blocked by a more important ticket.
- Blocked by the monolith rollout.
- A team member is ill.
- Blocked by the deployment freeze.
- Providing comments on blocked tickets is crucial. The reason for blocking should be clear.

Providing comments on blocked tickets is crucial. The reason for blocking should be clear.

The team’s board should reflect the real-time status of work items. Encourage team members to keep the status of the ticket updated. If you cannot work on a ticket any more, block it. If the ticket gets unblocked, remove the flag. Having such an agreement saves time on status updates and allows the whole team to see problems and act on them early.

During dailies, challenge the blockers and think of creative ways to unblock a ticket.

Watch out for the hidden blockers. If a ticket is taking too long to complete, it’s a good candidate for discussion in the daily stand-up or a quick brainstorming session.

Track the statistics of blockers and discuss them during retrospectives. This can bring useful ideas for future improvements.

## Focus on value versus activities

I struggle with Agile and Scrum that focus on activity tickets and Product Backlog Items (PBI). These might be broken down into even smaller tickets by the team. This becomes difficult to manage and is a drain on time.

So, what’s the fix? Track only value-added tickets. Avoid activity tickets as much as possible. It makes the scope clearer, more transparent, and gives you metrics that actually mean something.

First, break down value-added tickets as much as possible by acceptance criteria. If a ticket takes several days to complete, don’t overcomplicate it by breaking it into even smaller activity tasks.

Second, ditch the time-boxed tickets. You shouldn’t have a PBI that doesn’t fit the sprint, right? Unfortunately, this happens all the time, and teams end up cloning the same ticket over and over. This messes with your stats and makes it hard to track progress. The solution again? Break the ticket down by acceptance criteria.

# Definition of Done (DOD)

Define what 'done' looks like.

A good definition of done (DoD) should assume that any change is ready for production. This aligns well with common sense and makes it easier for everyone to understand the status.

## Finally

Try walking the board during stand-ups, focusing on clearing blockers, and keeping tickets centered on value. Scrum works best when it’s clear and efficient—not overloaded with complexity. Remember, no single system or piece of advice is one-size-fits-all. If a practice doesn’t work for your team, or if vertical buy-in to agile isn’t consistent, adapt flexibly to what suits your unique situation. Be pragmatic: let the process serve you, not the other way around.

\*_Remember to to pragmatic and not a slave to the process_
