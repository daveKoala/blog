*This post might be stretching a metephor, but bear with me*

For over a decade, I worked in the outdoor industry, running centres, supporting stage and screen rigging, and helping build a centre of excellence that even the Health and Safety Executive used for training.

In that world, safety isn’t a side project it’s the foundation everything rests on. Systems get reviewed, people are cross-trained, and refreshers are routine. Because the consequences of getting it wrong aren’t abstract — they’re physical, immediate, and sometimes fatal.

When I moved into software development, I was struck by how similar the stakes can be but how invisible the risks often are. We don’t talk about a “safety management system” in engineering, but we need one. Outages, cascading failures, security breaches, burnout, knowledge loss. These are the dev-world equivalents of rope system failure or a collapsed safety chains or rig.

So I started applying some of the thinking that kept climbers and technicians safe to the way I run and support development teams. What emerged is a way of working that’s calmer, more resilient, and a lot less likely to fall apart at 2am.

Here’s what that looks like.

## Applying Outdoor Principles to Dev Teams

In the outdoor world, we train for failure. Not because we expect it, but because we respect the complexity of what we’re doing and we know things go wrong. 

The same logic applies to building and maintaining software systems. Here are five principles I’ve carried over from that world and how they’ve helped my dev teams.

### 1. “Inspect Your Kit” → Code & Infrastructure Reviews

Outdoor instructors don’t just assume the gear works. Carabiners get checked. Ropes are logged and retired. Harnesses are triple-checked. You trust, but verify. Every time you leave tbe ground ir set off on the next pitch. 

In dev teams, we often let infrastructure rot quietly. Nobody’s looked at that Kubernetes manifest in months. That CI/CD pipeline script? Still running, but no one remembers how it works.

**Set aside time for system reviews**. Regularly check deployments, database settings, alert thresholds, and test coverage. Code reviews should go beyond syntax — they should catch bad assumptions and reinforce shared understanding.

---

### 2. “Know How to Self-Rescue” → Cross-Training

In rescue training, everyone learns how to help themselves and others. You don’t want the only person who knows how to escaoe  they system to effect a rescue to be the one hanging mid-air.

In dev, the equivalent is avoiding knowledge silos. If one person “owns” the deployment, and they’re off sick when production crashes, your team is in freefall.

**Cross-train**. Pair on things outside people’s comfort zones. Document just enough that someone else can step in — not with perfect grace, but enough to keep the rope taut.

---

### 3. “Run Drills” → Fire Drills & Chaos Engineering

We practiced rescues. We simulated injuries. We’d pretend to lose radio contact, lost or forgotten equipmenr, clients taken unwell or the chani g weather. Why? Because the worst time to figure out a plan is when the real thing is happening.

Dev teams should do the same. **Run “fire drills”** — simulate a downed service, expired certificate, or compromised token. Assign roles. See ha system and ow long it takes to respond. Afterwards, ask: *What helped? What didn’t?*

Even simple tabletop exercises can make a huge difference.

---

### 4. “Refreshers & Recerts” → Knowledge Maintenance

Instructors re-certify. First aiders refresh. Rope skills get rusty without use.

It’s the same in software. Just because someone *used to know* how the auth flow worked doesn’t mean they still do.

**Schedule internal talks**. Let juniors lead knowledge shares. Do walkthroughs of “old” parts of the code. You’re not just teaching — you’re de-risking.

---

### 5. “Trust the System, Not Just the People”

The best outdoor teams don’t rely on one superstar. They rely on systems. The harness either passes the safety check or it doesn’t. No exceptions.

Dev teams need the same mindset.

Don’t just hope things go right — design for **failure containment**. Use monitoring. Add circuit breakers. Have checklists. Automate recovery where possible.

Because if your team is one resignation or one incident away from disaster, that’s not a team — that’s a gamble.

## Closing Thoughts

When I talk to newer developers, I often tell them: *I’ve never felt the need to shout at someone falling off a cliff. I just check the belay system.* The same goes for software.

The best dev teams aren’t just fast or smart — they’re prepared.

So if you’ve ever led a group up a mountain or rappelled into a theatre ceiling, you already know more about good engineering culture than you think.

Take that knowledge, and build the kind of team you’d trust your life with — because, in many ways, we already do.
