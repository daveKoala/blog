# Welcome to Jekyll!
#
# This config file is meant for settings that affect your whole blog, values
# which you are expected to set up once and rarely edit after that. If you find
# yourself editing this file very often, consider using Jekyll's data files
# feature for the data you need to update frequently.
#
# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use
# 'bundle exec jekyll serve'. If you change this file, please restart the server process.

# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

  Welcome to my engineering diaryâ€”a private corner where my professional work takes a reflective turn. 
  Here, I chronicle challenges, breakthroughs, and insights that never make it to the public portfolio. 
  This space is both a brag sheet of personal achievements and a collection of musings on my approach to developing. 
  Join me as I share lessons learned along the way.
